Instructors:
The webpages are made to simulate logging in and out of an actual website, therefore, when you go to the login page,
you can choose to either log in as a client or as a staff member.

When logging in, the password is not require because this is a prototype.

Depending on what you choose, the dashboard presented to you will be different.

Several of the links on the staff dashboard are actual links while the links on the client dashboard do not link
to another page

When logged in and on either the, homepage / landing page, about us page or store page, you can click logout from the
navigation bar to log out of the current role and then proceed to the login page to log in as another role.
